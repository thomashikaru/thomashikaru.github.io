## About Me
I grew up in Tokyo, Japan but my family has moved around a lot since then. After graduating from college, I spent two years teaching HS Computer Science and Math in Jacksonville, FL. What I loved about being a teacher was the opportunity to make complex ideas accessible to students, as well as engaging in coaching and mentorship. I have three sisters, a mixed-breed rescue dog, and Bi-Racial Identity Confusion Syndrome (BRICS).

## Interests
I am broadly interested in machine learning for NLP, linguistics, data science, etc. More specifically within NLP, I am interested in sequence-to-sequence models and context-sensitive word embeddings. I am excited about the computational models of human cognition, and the intersection between NLP and cognitive science. 

My other interests include urban design, maps, AI ethics, language learning, and philosophy. 

## Education
I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Princeton University, where I also earned certificates in Linguistics and Russian Language & Culture. 
I earned a M.Ed. from the University of Notre Dame as part of the ACE Teaching Fellows 25th Cohort. I am currently pursuing an MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics from the University of Cambridge, where I am involved in the Language Technology Lab. 

## Experience
Most recently, I interned on the IBM Watson Speech to Text team, working on machine learning approaches for speech recognition and dataset verification. Previously, I have done iOS development for the Paideia Institute in Rome, Italy, and have done volunteer service projects in Russia and Japan.
