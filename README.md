Hi! I'm Thomas :)

## Interests
I am interested in the principles underlying human language and cognition, and how the tools of NLP, information theory, and probabilistic inference can shed light on these principles. My primary line of research involves building algorithmic models of "noisy-channel language processing", explaining how humans are able to extract meaning from anomalous or erroneous utterances in a cognitively plausible and resource-rational way. 

I've also done projects investigating what factors influence how speakers choose between two possible ways of saying the same thing, looking at the Russian comparative alternation as a case study via both corpus study and behavioral experimentation; what makes some sentences more memorable than others, what might explain why languages have the word orders that they do; and what speakers modulate how they talk to emphasize surprising words in conversation.  

My other interests include urban design, maps, AI ethics, language learning, science communication, and philosophy.

## Education
I am currently a PhD candidate at MIT in the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, where I am a member of [TedLab](http://tedlab.mit.edu/) and the [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/). I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Princeton University, where I also earned certificates in Linguistics and Russian Language & Culture. After college, I earned an M.Ed. from the University of Notre Dame as part of the ACE Teaching Fellows 25th Cohort; I [taught](https://ace.nd.edu/news/getting-things-done-escape-room-style) HS Computer Science and Math in Jacksonville, FL. Afterwards, I returned to grad school for an MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics from the University of Cambridge, where I was involved in the [Language Technology Lab](http://ltl.mml.cam.ac.uk/) and continued on to a PhD in a different city named Cambridge. 

## Other Experience
Before starting my PhD, I interned at Vimeo on the Machine Learning Research team and at IBM Watson on the Speech to Text team. Previously, I have done iOS development for the Paideia Institute in Rome, Italy, and have done volunteer service projects in Russia and Japan. During the summer of 2021, I was an instructor for a summer startup camp at the Cambridge Center for International Research, teaching machine learning and data science principles to students from around the world.
