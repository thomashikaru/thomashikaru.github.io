## About Me
I grew up in Tokyo, Japan but my family has moved around a lot since then. After graduating from college, I spent two years teaching HS Computer Science and Math in Jacksonville, FL. I have three sisters, a mixed-breed rescue dog, and Bi-Racial Identity Confusion Syndrome (BRICS). 

## Interests
I am interested in machine learning for NLP, linguistics, data science, etc. My other interests include urban design, maps, AI ethics, language learning, and philosophy. 

## Education
I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Princeton University, where I also earned certificates in Linguistics and Russian Language & Culture. 
I earned a M.Ed. from the University of Notre Dame as part of the ACE Teaching Fellows 25th Cohort. I am beginning an MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics from the University of Cambridge in October 2020. 

## Experience
I am currently working as a Cognitive Developer Intern for Data & AI at IBM on the Speech to Text team. Previously, I have done iOS development for the Paideia Institute in Rome, Italy, and have done volunteer service projects in Russia and Japan.
